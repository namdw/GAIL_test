# GAIL_test
This is my simple implementation of Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning by Ho et al.

I do not hold any right to any part of the algorithm itself. 

This is programmed using python 3.5 and Tensorflow. 

There is only one script which contains both network classes and the main. 

run gail.py to execute code

## Expert data
The expert data was trained using DQN. 

The samples are ones that scored over 200
